    "Classification techniques are an essential part of machine learning and data mining applications. Approximately 70% of problems in Data Science are classification problems. There are lots of classification problems that are available, but the logistics regression is common and is a useful regression method for solving the binary classification problem. Another category of classification is Multinomial classification, which handles the issues where multiple classes are present in the target variable. For example, IRIS dataset a very famous example of multi-class classification. Other examples are classifying article/blog/document category.\n",

    "Logistic Regression can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection. Diabetes prediction, if a given customer will purchase a particular product or will they churn another competitor, whether the user will click on a given advertisement link or not, and many more examples are in the bucket.\n",

    "Logistic Regression is one of the most simple and commonly used Machine Learning algorithms for two-class classification. It is easy to implement and can be used as the baseline for any binary classification problem. Its basic fundamental concepts are also constructive in deep learning. Logistic regression describes and estimates the relationship between one dependent binary variable and independent variables.\n",

    "Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means there are only two possible classes. For example, it can be used for cancer detection problems. It computes the probability of an event occurrence.\n",

Maximizing the likelihood function determines the parameters that are most likely to produce the observed data. From a statistical point of view, MLE sets the mean and variance as parameters in determining the specific parametric values for a given model. This set of parameters can be used for predicting the data needed in a normal distribution.\n",

    "Ordinary Least squares estimates are computed by fitting a regression line on given data points that has the minimum sum of the squared deviations (least square error). Both are used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. MLE assumes a joint probability mass function, while OLS doesn't require any stochastic assumptions for minimizing distance."

If the output of the sigmoid function is more than 0.5, we can classify the outcome as 1 or YES, and if it is less than 0.5, we can classify it as 0 or NO.

    "Because of its efficient and straightforward nature, doesn't require high computation power, easy to implement, easily interpretable, used widely by data analyst and scientist. Also, it doesn't require scaling of features. Logistic regression provides a probability score for observations.\n",

    "Logistic regression is not able to handle a large number of categorical features/variables. It is vulnerable to overfitting. Also, can't solve the non-linear problem with the logistic regression that is why it requires a transformation of non-linear features. Logistic regression will not perform well with independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable and are very similar or correlated to each other.\n",
